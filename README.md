## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The difference of a contain and a cover background property.

My first mobile-first workflow ðŸ’¯ ... I loved it ....didn't have to use too much media queries as always

Tried using Adobe XD for perfect layout look and ended up leaving it completely... will perfect that later ....the px dimensions generated were too big ...decided to wing itðŸ˜Ž

```html
<h1>Some CSS I'm NOT proud of at all</h1>
```
```css
@media (min-width: 533px) {
  .summary__card {
    margin: 8rem auto;
    max-width: 370px;
  }

  .card__content {
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Overall speed
Better class names
Mobile First workflow
